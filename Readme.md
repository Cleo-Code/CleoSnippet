**CleoSnippets**
--
___
CleoSnippets was created with the intention of providing a set of Snippets for CleoCode developers to give them more time through these simple Snippets!

**How is it used?**

All CleoCode Snippets will start with the prefix "cl" giving them an easy to learn indicator, for example:

to write an Arrow Function in CleoSnippet you should write the following: " claf ". 

**How can I use it?**

It's very simple, just go to the folder called #CleoSnippets and copy the entire #CleoSnippetsV1 file.

Then go to your VsCode and click on settings > User Snippets ![alt MenuToSnippet](/MenuToSnippet.png)

 click on New Global Snippets file and name it "CleoSnippets" ![alt text](/SnippetGlobal.png)
 
  once the file is created you should paste everything you have copied in #CleoSnippetsV1 and it will be ready to use, remember NOT to move anything!

**Anatomy**

The example of the previous case would be as follows: claf

cl -- Prefix ( to be used in all snippets )

af -- Arrow Function ( Initials or indicative of the word )
